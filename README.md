X-Ray effect using jQuery
====

Two images are used here, an upper image, and a sub image. A view window can be slide over the upper image, revealing the sub image, along with any data points that may be defined. Colorbox is used to display further information when these data points are clicked.

I've whittled it down to as basic an implementation as I can. Can easily be adapted to work with database loaded information, or even an annotation system.
